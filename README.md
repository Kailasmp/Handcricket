### Hand Cricket Game in Python

This project is a simple, text-based hand cricket game where you play against the computer. The game starts with a toss, followed by an innings where either you or the computer bats. The objective is to outscore your opponent or defend your target.

### How It Works:
1. **Toss**: You choose "Even" or "Odd" and a number from 1 to 6. The computer randomly picks a number. The sum determines the winner.
2. **Bat or Bowl**: If you win the toss, you can choose to bat or bowl. If the computer wins, it makes a random choice.
3. **Gameplay**: Players take turns batting and bowling. The batter scores runs unless the bowler matches their number, in which case the batter is out.
4. **Result**: After both innings, the game declares a winner based on who scored the most runs.

### Features:
- Toss simulation (Even or Odd).
- User input and random computer responses.
- Score tracking for both players.
- Result announcement (win, lose, or tie).

### How to Play:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the `handcricket.py` file.
3. Follow the instructions to play the game.

### Future Enhancements:
- Add a GUI using libraries like `Tkinter`.
- Introduce multiple overs or difficulty levels.
